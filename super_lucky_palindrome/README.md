The original problem : https://www.spoj.com/problems/CTPLUCKY/

x axis : query (between 1 and 10 million) \
y axis : time in seconds \
v1 in red, v2 in green \
![v1 and v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoyoshix/Super-Lucky-Palindrome/master/super_lucky_palindrome/v1v2.png)

x axis : log10(query) \
y axis : time in seconds \
v3 in blue, v4 in orange, v5 in grey \

v4 is done \
Algorithm is done \
I never expected the algorithm to be this fast (he can get the 10^1000th input in 10sec). It's really incredible. Thanks python to have no limits of digits with your integers

v5 is done, I've optimized v4 by a little bit and added some features
