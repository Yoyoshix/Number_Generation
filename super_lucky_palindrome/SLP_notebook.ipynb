    "\n",
    "This notebook will present my work on the problem I had really fun solving for the past three months.\n",
    "At first, I solved this problem with a naive algorithm (v1 and v2) but they were not fast enough to solve the 10^18th index that problem's statement wants (reaching this point would have taken a year with v2 I think).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you'll find the predata code which helps to get initial parameters for v1, v2 and to better understand the fundamentals off next algorithms. <br>\n",
    "All five algorithm's versions I did to solve the problem. <br>\n",
    "At the end a time comparison between these algorithms which will suprise you I think :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Little vocabulary :\n",
    "- A lucky number is a positive integer only made of \"4\" and \"7\"\n",
    "- A super lucky number is a lucky number where its amount of digit and its amount of \"4\" or \"7\" is a lucky number\n",
    "- A super lucky palindrome is a super lucky number which is also a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)\n",
    "- Super Lucky Palindrome will be called SLP\n",

    "First, I know we're looking for a palindrome. It means that I can work with only one side of the number and mirror my result at the end.<br>\n",
    "Remember, a SLP must have specific amounts of \"4\" and \"7\". Within one part, I need to find what are all possible amount that can create a valid SLP. I called these values \"pair numbers\". (Pair because if you know the amount of \"4\" you can guess the amount of \"7\" by doing length-\"4\")<br>\n",
    "Once I do that, I can use [binomial coeficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) to directly know how much possibilities exists with the length I am working on by using the pair numbers I just found.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code print 3 differents values :\n",
    "- Possible numbers length which are 4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444. Going further is useless because the 10^18th index is contained in the 444 length.\n",
    "- Pair numbers. Mind that pair numbers represent the amount for only one side of the palindrome\n",
    "- Amount of possibilities for each length.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little issue I need to solve about odd length palindrome number and their middle digit.<br>\n",
    "For this, I create a condition like : If the middle digit is a \"4\" , does it make a SLP ? (same with a \"7\")<br>\n",
    "Hopefully only one solution is valid, the middle digit is either a \"4\" or a \"7\", never both.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this predata code can be verified easily if you start to find the first SLP, you'll see the datas are matching with the results :p"

    "Now the algorithms are going to change by a lot. Let's explain the new logic behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already use a part of this logic, in the predata code. There, I was able to find how much possibilities were contained inside a given length once pair numbers had been found.<br>\n",
    "So by using the same logic, we're going to skip a good amount of solutions by putting \"7\" exactly where we have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the essence of the logic by using it on arbitrary parameters.<br> \n",
    "Exemple with these parameters : length = 4, pair = [0,2], query = 9. It means we are looking for the 9th solution within a length of 4 where we can only put either zero \"7\" OR two \"7\".\n",
    "This gives these possibilities :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 4444\n",
    "- 2 > 4477\n",
    "- 3 > 4747\n",
    "- 4 > 4774\n",
    "- 5 > 7447\n",
    "- 6 > 7474\n",
    "- 7 > 7744\n",
    "\n",
    "They are seven of them. The amount of these possibilities is calculated with the same algorithm in the predata code.<br>\n",
    "BUT, my query is currently 9, so I am sure that the first \"7\" to put will NOT appear in this 4 length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, If I calculate with a length of 5 it gives this :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 44444\n",
    "- 2 > 44477\n",
    "- 3 > 44747\n",

    "- 9 > 74474\n",
    "- 10>74744\n",
    "- 11>77444\n",
    "\n",
    "The query 9 now appears inside these solution. I am definitely sure that the first \"7\" to put will be at this new index.<br>\n",
    "So now I do a little trick, I decrease the value of query by the amount of possibilities from length-1. In others terms, I \"remove\" the 4 length possibilities (possibilities that doesn't have a \"7\" at their last position). Remember, there was 7 solutions in 4 length, so my query is now equal to 9-7 = 2.<br>\n",
    "Mind that we also need to decrease the pair values because we just put one \"7\". That means the pair[0] won't be possible anymore !\n",

    "Two solutions in 2 length (74447, 74474), our query is equal to 2 so we know that there is a \"7\" in this new solution.\n",
    "And we're done because we put all the \"7\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to do the same.<br>\n",
    "1) We need to know the real query. To do that we have to :<br>\n",
    "1.1) Try successives correct SLP length (4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444 ...)<br>\n",
    "1.2) Get the pair numbers of this length<br>\n",
    "1.2) Calculate the amount of possibilities this length have by using pair numbers<br>\n",
    "1.3) Decrease the value of query by this amount<br>\n",
    "1.4) If query is < 0, we got the length. Else we need to continue with the next possible length\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now we have the real query we will put \"7\" step by step<br>\n",
    "2.1) Store all amount of possibilities for each value between 1 and length<br>\n",
    "2.2) Detect what is the index of the maximum value <= real query<br>\n",
    "2.3) Put one \"7\" in solution at this index<br>\n",

    "2.5) Update length by index<br>\n",
    "2.6) Restart while length > 0 and real query > 0 and len(pair_number) > 0\n",
