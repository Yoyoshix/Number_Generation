    "This notebook will present my work on the problem I had really fun solving for the past three months.\n",
    "At first, I solved this problem with a naive algorithm (v1 and v2) but they were not fast enough to solve the 10^18th index that problem's statement wants (reaching this point would have taken a year with v2 I think).\n",

    "All five algorithm's versions I did to solve the problem. <br>\n",
    "At the end a time comparison between these algorithms which will suprise you I think :)\n",

    "- A super lucky number is a lucky number where its amount of digit and its amount of \"4\" or \"7\" is a lucky number\n",

    "Within one part, I need to find the possible amount of \"4\" and \"7\" that can create a valid SLP. I called these values \"pair numbers\". (Pair because if you know the amount of \"4\" you can guess the amount of \"7\" by doing length-\"4\")<br>\n",

    "The idea is simple, create every possibilities and check for every possibility if its a SLP.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain how it works. First, I need to get the real query value.<br>\n",
    "The real query symbolize the query we are looking for inside a given length. If you try the algorithm with queries 1, 3, 11, 475 you'll see that these solutions are filled with \"4\" only. What is important to note is that the initial query can be calculated really fast. In the end, it all depends about the \"real\" query.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the real query it's quite simple, I substract to the initial query the values contained in range_list array which stores the amount of possibilities for each length. I do that until I reach a negative value. It's like saying \"ok, my query will not be in this length, let's skip the possibilities of this length\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Real query is also influanced by reverse value. Imagine looking for the last solution of a length, it will be filled by \"7\" only. Which correspond in fact as an all \"4\" solution where you swap numbers. So this solution will have a real query of 1. I need to update that in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the recursive function :<br>\n",
    "Instead of having an empty array and placing either a \"4\" or a \"7\" inside it I create an all \"4\" (or \"7\") array and I just change the values if I have to. This way I can create a more generic code and a slightly faster algorithm."

    "\n",
    "Now the algorithms are going to change by a lot. Let's explain the new logic behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already use a part of this logic, in the predata code. There, I was able to find how much possibilities were contained inside a given length once pair numbers had been found.<br>\n",
    "So by using the same logic, we're going to skip a good amount of solutions by putting \"7\" exactly where we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the essence of the logic by using it on arbitrary parameters.<br> \n",
    "Exemple with these parameters : length = 4, pair = [0,2], query = 9. So we are looking for the 9th solution with a length of 4 where we can only put either zero \"7\" OR two \"7\".\n",
    "This gives these possibilities :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 4444\n",
    "- 2 > 4477\n",
    "- 3 > 4747\n",
    "- 4 > 4774\n",
    "- 5 > 7447\n",
    "- 6 > 7474\n",
    "- 7 > 7744\n",
    "\n",
    "They are seven of them. The amount of these possibilities is calculated with the same algorithm in the predata code.<br>\n",
    "BUT, my query is currently 9, so I am sure that the first \"7\" to put will NOT appear in this 4 length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, If I calculate with a length of 5 it gives this :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 44444\n",
    "- 2 > 44477\n",
    "- 3 > 44747\n",
    "- 4 > 44774\n",
    "- 5 > 47447\n",
    "- 6 > 47474\n",
    "- 7 > 47744\n",
    "- 8 > 74447\n",
    "- 9 > 74474\n",
    "- 10>74744\n",
    "- 11>77444\n",
    "\n",
    "The query 9 now appears inside these solution. I am definitely sure that the first \"7\" to put will be at this new index.<br>\n",
    "So now I do a little trick, I decrease the value of query by the amount of possibilities from length-1. In others terms, I \"remove\" the 4 length possibilities (possibilities that doesn't have a \"7\" at their last position). Remember, there was 7 solutions in 4 length. My query is now equal to 9-7 = 2.<br>\n",
    "Mind that we also need to decrease the pair values because we just put one \"7\". That means the pair[0] won't be possible anymore !\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we can continue with our current parameters : length = 1, pair = [1], query = 2. This gives :<br>\n",
    "One solution in 1 length (74447). We need to look for at least 2 solutions, this is not enough so we need to try for the next length.<br>\n",
    "Two solutions in 2 length (74447, 74474), our query is equal to 2 so we know that there is a \"7\" in this new solution.\n",
    "And we're done because we put all the \"7\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to do the same.<br>\n",
    "1) We need to know the real query. To do that we have to :<br>\n",
    "1.1) Try successives correct SLP length (4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444 ...)<br>\n",
    "1.2) Get the pair numbers of this length<br>\n",
    "1.2) Calculate the amount of possibilities this length have by using pair numbers<br>\n",
    "1.3) Decrease the value of query by this amount<br>\n",
    "1.4) If query is < 0, we got the length. Else we need to continue with the next possible length\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now we have the real query we will put \"7\" step by step<br>\n",
    "2.1) Store all amount of possibilities for each value between 1 and length<br>\n",
    "2.2) Detect what is the index of the maximum value <= real query<br>\n",
    "2.3) Put one \"7\" in solution array at this index<br>\n",
    "2.4) Decrease real query by the amount and decrease pair numbers by 1<br>\n",
    "2.5) Update length by index<br>\n",
    "2.6) Restart while length > 0 and real query > 0 and len(pair_number) > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some littles things i'm not talking about but here you have the essence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also removed the reverse feature because it was kinda useless, the algorithm was very fast already."

    "So here it is, the final version. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What changed ? Two things.<br>\n",
    "The first one is is the verbose feature. You can now use lucky_v5(True) to enable it. That will displays some cool statistics during the computation of big length numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second the apparition of the exponential search. Let's explain why it's here !<br>\n",
    "What takes a huge amount of time is the self.get_possibilities(). If we can limit at maximum the amount of times this function is called we will optimize the algorithm even more.<br>\n",
    "We know that the amount of possibilities between 0 and space is sorted.<br>\n",
    "After some time working on the algorithm I figure out that the index we're looking for are at the beginning of the array. We can use these clues to research values with an exponential search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed has been also implemented (it doesn't change much the result, it was just for the glory)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, everything has been implemented and I don't really see where I could optimize the algorithm even more.<br>\n",
    "I'm really proud of this journey that comes to its end. It's been fun solving this problem.\n",
