    "\n",
    "This notebook will present my work on the problem I had really fun solving for the past three months.\n",
    "At first, I solved this problem with a naive algorithm (v1 and v2) but they were not fast enough to solve the 10^18th index that problem's statement wants (reaching this point would have taken a year with v2 I think).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you'll find the predata code which helps to get initial parameters for v1, v2 and to better understand the fundamentals off next algorithms. <br>\n",
    "All five algorithm's versions I did to solve the problem. <br>\n",
    "At the end a time comparison between these algorithms which will suprise you I think :)\n",

    "- A lucky number is a positive integer only made of \"4\" and \"7\"\n",
    "- A super lucky number is a lucky number where its amount of digit and its amount of \"4\" or \"7\" is a lucky number\n",
    "- A super lucky palindrome is a super lucky number which is also a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)\n",
    "- Super Lucky Palindrome will be called SLP\n",

    "First, I know we're looking for a palindrome. It means that I can work with only one side of the number and mirror my result at the end.<br>\n",
    "Remember, a SLP must have specific amounts of \"4\" and \"7\". Within one part, I need to find what are all possible amount that can create a valid SLP. I called these values \"pair numbers\". (Pair because if you know the amount of \"4\" you can guess the amount of \"7\" by doing length-\"4\")<br>\n",
    "Once I do that, I can use [binomial coeficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) to directly know how much possibilities exists with the length I am working on by using the pair numbers I just found.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code print 3 differents values :\n",
    "- Possible numbers length which are 4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444. Going further is useless because the 10^18th index is contained in the 444 length.\n",
    "- Pair numbers. Mind that pair numbers represent the amount for only one side of the palindrome\n",
    "- Amount of possibilities for each length.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little issue I need to solve about odd length palindrome number and their middle digit.<br>\n",
    "For this, I create a condition like : If the middle digit is a \"4\" , does it make a SLP ? (same with a \"7\")<br>\n",
    "Hopefully only one solution is valid, the middle digit is either a \"4\" or a \"7\", never both.\n",
    "\n",

    "The idea is simple, create every possibilities and check for every possibility if its a SLP.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain how it works. First, I need to get the real query value.<br>\n",
    "The real query symbolize the query we are looking for inside a given length. If you try the algorithm with queries 1, 3, 11, 475 you'll see that these solutions are filled with \"4\" only. So we need to get this real query value because all these solutions have the same real query value of 1.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the real query it's quite simple, I substract to the initial query the values contained in range_list array which stores the amount of possibilities for each length. I do that until I reach a negative value. It's like saying \"ok, my query will not be in this length, let's skip the possibilities of this length\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Real query is also influanced by reverse value. Imagine looking for the last solution of a length, it will be filled by \"7\" only. Which correspond in fact as an all \"4\" solution where you swap numbers. So this solution will have a real query of 1. I need to update that in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the recursive function :<br>\n",
    "Instead of having an empty array and placing either a \"4\" or a \"7\" inside it I create an all \"4\" (or \"7\") array and I just change the values if I have to. This way I can create a more generic code and a slightly faster algorithm."

    "\n",
    "Now the algorithms are going to change by a lot. Let's explain the new logic behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already use a part of this logic, in the predata code. There, I was able to find how much possibilities were contained inside a given length once pair numbers had been found.<br>\n",
    "So by using the same logic, we're going to skip a good amount of solutions by putting \"7\" exactly where we have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the essence of the logic by using it on arbitrary parameters.<br> \n",
    "Exemple with these parameters : length = 4, pair = [0,2], query = 9. It means we are looking for the 9th solution within a length of 4 where we can only put either zero \"7\" OR two \"7\".\n",
    "This gives these possibilities :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 4444\n",
    "- 2 > 4477\n",
    "- 3 > 4747\n",
    "- 4 > 4774\n",
    "- 5 > 7447\n",
    "- 6 > 7474\n",
    "- 7 > 7744\n",
    "\n",
    "They are seven of them. The amount of these possibilities is calculated with the same algorithm in the predata code.<br>\n",
    "BUT, my query is currently 9, so I am sure that the first \"7\" to put will NOT appear in this 4 length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, If I calculate with a length of 5 it gives this :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 44444\n",
    "- 2 > 44477\n",
    "- 3 > 44747\n",
    "- 4 > 44774\n",
    "- 5 > 47447\n",
    "- 6 > 47474\n",
    "- 7 > 47744\n",
    "- 8 > 74447\n",
    "- 9 > 74474\n",
    "- 10>74744\n",
    "- 11>77444\n",
    "\n",
    "The query 9 now appears inside these solution. I am definitely sure that the first \"7\" to put will be at this new index.<br>\n",
    "So now I do a little trick, I decrease the value of query by the amount of possibilities from length-1. In others terms, I \"remove\" the 4 length possibilities (possibilities that doesn't have a \"7\" at their last position). Remember, there was 7 solutions in 4 length, so my query is now equal to 9-7 = 2.<br>\n",
    "Mind that we also need to decrease the pair values because we just put one \"7\". That means the pair[0] won't be possible anymore !\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we can continue with our current parameters : length = 1, pair = [1], query = 2. This gives :<br>\n",
    "One solution in 1 length (74447). That is not enough solution, out query is 2. Let's check next length.<br>\n",
    "Two solutions in 2 length (74447, 74474), our query is equal to 2 so we know that there is a \"7\" in this new solution.\n",
    "And we're done because we put all the \"7\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to do the same.<br>\n",
    "1) We need to know the real query. To do that we have to :<br>\n",
    "1.1) Try successives correct SLP length (4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444 ...)<br>\n",
    "1.2) Get the pair numbers of this length<br>\n",
    "1.2) Calculate the amount of possibilities this length have by using pair numbers<br>\n",
    "1.3) Decrease the value of query by this amount<br>\n",
    "1.4) If query is < 0, we got the length. Else we need to continue with the next possible length\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now we have the real query we will put \"7\" step by step<br>\n",
    "2.1) Store all amount of possibilities for each value between 1 and length<br>\n",
    "2.2) Detect what is the index of the maximum value <= real query<br>\n",
    "2.3) Put one \"7\" in solution at this index<br>\n",
    "2.4) Decrease real query by the amount found and decrease pair numbers by 1<br>\n",
    "2.5) Update length by index<br>\n",
    "2.6) Restart while length > 0 and real query > 0 and len(pair_number) > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some littles things i'm not talking about but here you have the essence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also removed the reverse feature because it was kinda useless, the algorithm was very fast already."

    "So here it is, the final version. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What changed ? Two things.<br>\n",
    "The first one is the verbose feature. You can now use lucky_v5(True) to enable it. That will displays some cool statistics during the computation of big length numbers. (10^100 and more)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second is the apparition of the exponential search. Let's explain why it's here !<br>\n",
    "What takes a huge amount of time is the self.get_possibilities(). If we can limit at maximum the amount of times this function is called we will optimize the algorithm even more.<br>\n",
    "We know that the amount of possibilities between 0 and space is sorted and that the index we're looking for is mostly at the end of the array. We can use these clues to get the index we want with an exponential search.<br>\n",
    "Even tho comb array is not used anymore, the logic behind the computation remain the same and we can apply this kind of search algorithm for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed has been also implemented (it doesn't change much the result, it was just for the glory)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, everything has been implemented and I don't really see where I could optimize the algorithm even more.<br>\n",
    "I'm really proud of this journey that comes to its end. It's been fun solving this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there anything I want to do ? Not really. Thanks for reading."
