    "This notebook will present my work on the problem I had really fun solving for the past three months.\n",
    "At first, I solved this problem with a naive algorithm (v1 and v2) but they were not fast enough to solve the 10^18th index that problem's statement wants (reaching this point would have taken a year with v2 I think).\n",

    "- A super lucky number is a lucky number where its amount of digit and its amount of \"4\" or \"7\" is a lucky number\n",
    "- A super lucky palindrome is a super lucky number which is also a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)\n",

    "Remember, a SLP must have specific amounts of \"4\" and \"7\". Within one part, I need to find what are all possible amount that can create a valid SLP. I called these values \"pair numbers\". (Pair because if you know the amount of \"4\" you can guess the amount of \"7\" by doing length-\"4\")<br>\n",
    "Once I do that, I can use [binomial coeficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) to directly know how much possibilities exists with the length I am working on by using the pair numbers I just found.<br>\n",

    "- Possible numbers length which are 4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444. Going further is useless because the 10^18th index is contained in the 444 length.\n",
    "- Pair numbers. Mind that pair numbers represent the amount for only one side of the palindrome\n",
    "- Amount of possibilities for each length.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little issue I need to solve about odd length palindrome number and their middle digit.<br>\n",
    "For this, I create a condition like : If the middle digit is a \"4\" , does it make a SLP ? (same with a \"7\")<br>\n",
    "Hopefully only one solution is valid, the middle digit is either a \"4\" or a \"7\", never both.\n",

    "Now the algorithms are going to change by a lot. Let's explain the new logic behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already use a part of this logic, in the predata code. There, I was able to find how much possibilities were contained inside a given length once pair numbers had been found.<br>\n",
    "So by using the same logic, we're going to skip a good amount of solutions by putting \"7\" exactly where we have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the essence of the logic by using it on arbitrary parameters.<br> \n",
    "Exemple with these parameters : length = 4, pair = [0,2], query = 9. It means we are looking for the 9th solution within a length of 4 where we can only put either zero \"7\" OR two \"7\".\n",
    "This gives these possibilities :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 4444\n",
    "- 2 > 4477\n",
    "- 3 > 4747\n",
    "- 4 > 4774\n",
    "- 5 > 7447\n",
    "- 6 > 7474\n",
    "- 7 > 7744\n",
    "\n",
    "They are seven of them. The amount of these possibilities is calculated with the same algorithm in the predata code.<br>\n",
    "BUT, my query is currently 9, so I am sure that the first \"7\" to put will NOT appear in this 4 length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, If I calculate with a length of 5 it gives this :<br>\n",
    "- 1 > 44444\n",
    "- 2 > 44477\n",
    "- 3 > 44747\n",
    "- 4 > 44774\n",
    "- 5 > 47447\n",
    "- 6 > 47474\n",
    "- 7 > 47744\n",
    "- 8 > 74447\n",
    "- 9 > 74474\n",
    "- 10>74744\n",
    "- 11>77444\n",
    "\n",
    "The query 9 now appears inside these solution. I am definitely sure that the first \"7\" to put will be at this new index.<br>\n",
    "So now I do a little trick, I decrease the value of query by the amount of possibilities from length-1. In others terms, I \"remove\" the 4 length possibilities (possibilities that doesn't have a \"7\" at their last position). Remember, there was 7 solutions in 4 length, so my query is now equal to 9-7 = 2.<br>\n",
    "Mind that we also need to decrease the pair values because we just put one \"7\". That means the pair[0] won't be possible anymore !\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we can continue with our current parameters : length = 1, pair = [1], query = 2. This gives :<br>\n",
    "One solution in 1 length (74447). That is not enough solution, out query is 2. Let's check next length.<br>\n",
    "Two solutions in 2 length (74447, 74474), our query is equal to 2 so we know that there is a \"7\" in this new solution.\n",
    "And we're done because we put all the \"7\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to do the same.<br>\n",
    "1) We need to know the real query. To do that we have to :<br>\n",
    "1.1) Try successives correct SLP length (4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444 ...)<br>\n",
    "1.2) Get the pair numbers of this length<br>\n",
    "1.2) Calculate the amount of possibilities this length have by using pair numbers<br>\n",
    "1.3) Decrease the value of query by this amount<br>\n",
    "1.4) If query is < 0, we got the length. Else we need to continue with the next possible length\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now we have the real query we will put \"7\" step by step<br>\n",
    "2.1) Store all amount of possibilities for each value between 1 and length<br>\n",
    "2.2) Detect what is the index of the maximum value <= real query<br>\n",
    "2.3) Put one \"7\" in solution at this index<br>\n",
    "2.4) Decrease real query by the amount found and decrease pair numbers by 1<br>\n",
    "2.5) Update length by index<br>\n",
    "2.6) Restart while length > 0 and real query > 0 and len(pair_number) > 0\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some littles things i'm not talking about but here you have the essence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also removed the reverse feature because it was kinda useless, the algorithm was very fast already."
